# cuky

## What is it?

cuky is a vectorial database that focuses on _scalability_, _performance_ and _ACID compliance_.

### About the name

My family use to call me _cuky_ and I do love cookies with milk so I called it _cuky_ because of the spelling similarity to **_cookie_**

## Motivations

- I love programming and computers
- I want to explore the world of vectorial databases
- I want to expand my knowledge about programming concepts like sharding or vectors itself.
- I would love to go to the MIT so I want to create projects so I prove that I deserve it.

## Getting started

At this moment I am working on the basic functionality so I would like to have a prototype ready soon.

## Aknowledge

I would love to thank anyone that have helped me on this or any other project or in the real life (sometimes **_touch grass command_** has to be executed)
